Arduino Adapter

This is currently coded for the Arduino WiFi Rev2 (which also secretly supports Bluetooth as well.)  Please make sure to update the firmware before using this.

It also has some code to write to EEPROM for a toalizer to keep a running count should their be powerloss.  This will hopefully be expanded in the future to make use of NTP servers as well.
